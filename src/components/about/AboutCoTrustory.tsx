                         I purchased my house and used Tru Realty and couldnâ€™t be happier with the results.  My agent, Sarah Richardson was well-versed in the neighborhoods I was interested in, showed me several options, and fought for me every step of the way with a relentless seller. I have recommended them to several other potential buyers and sellers and would do so several times over!
