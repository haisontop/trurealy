                                    The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing
                                    discrimination on the basis of race, color,
                                    religion, sex, disability, familial status,
                                    and national origin. Its coverage includes
                                    private housing, housing that receives
                                    Federal financial assistance, and State and
                                    local government housing. It is unlawful to
                                    discriminate in any aspect of selling or
                                    renting housing or to deny a dwelling to a
                                    buyer or renter because of the disability of
                                    that individual, an individual associated
                                    with the buyer or renter, or an individual
                                    who intends to live in the residence. Other
                                    covered activities include, for example,
                                    financing, zoning practices, new
                                    construction design, and advertising.

                                    The Fair Housing Act requires owners of
                                    housing facilities to make reasonable
                                    exceptions in their policies and operations
                                    to afford people with disabilities equal
                                    housing opportunities. For example, a
                                    landlord with a “no pets” policy may be
                                    required to grant an exception to this rule
                                    and allow an individual who is blind to keep
                                    a guide dog in the residence. The Fair
                                    Housing Act also requires landlords to allow
                                    tenants with disabilities to make reasonable
                                    access-related modifications to their
                                    private living space, as well as to common
                                    use spaces. The Act further requires that
                                    new multifamily housing with four or more
                                    units be designed and built to allow access
                                    for persons with disabilities. This includes
                                    accessible common use areas, doors that are
                                    wide enough for wheelchairs, kitchens and
                                    bathrooms that allow a person using a
                                    wheelchair to maneuver, and other adaptable
                                    features within the units.
