                                <h2>REFUNDS FOR THE FUNDAMENTALS AND THE ACADEMY</h2>
                                <p>Because of the nature of the courses, as a result of your license being hung and because you receive the complete materials at the beginning of the course, we do not offer refunds on the Fundamentals and the Academy portions of the training courses. We do however offer a money back guarantee if you follow all the requirements of the course and the accountability program and do not
                                    sell/rent a property within a year. You are required to complete all steps of the ongoing accountability program, including and not limited to: all calls, uploading contacts into CRM, email blasts, social media marketing blasts, personal development courses etc. </p>
