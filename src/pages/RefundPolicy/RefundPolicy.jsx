            <p>
              If for some reason you are not 100% satisfied with your real estate education courses, were unable to pass your exam, or EXPERIENCED a life-changing event that prevented you from course completion, you may request a refund. Our partnership with Colibri's Real Estate Express, provides you with a 100% satisfaction guarantee on your pre-license education courses. Together, our commitment to quality education promises peace of mind and a student success rate that is second to none. <br /><br />Refunds for Colibri online and livestream courses are processed as follows:

              <h3>ONLINE COURSES</h3>
              <p>
                If after one week, your courses don't feel right, request a full refund — no questions asked. (Please note that if you haven't started a course, you have one month from purchase to submit your request.)

              <h3> LIVESTREAM COURSES</h3>
              <p>
                Through the end of the first day in your first livestream course, you can request a 100% refund*. If you cancel within the first week of your first livestream course, you can request a 75% refund. (Please note that you cannot request a refund after you've attempted the final exam.) Additionally, you can transfer to another livestream course — or an equivalent online course, where available — for a $50 fee within the first week of any livestream course.
                <br />
                <br />
                To receive credit for any livestream course, you must attend the first day.

              <h3> REFUNDS FOR THE FUNDAMENTALS AND THE ACADEMY </h3>
              <p>
                Because of the nature of the courses, as a result of your license being hung and because you receive the complete materials at the beginning of the course, we do not offer refunds on the Fundamentals and the Academy portions of the training courses. We do however offer a money back guarantee if you follow all the requirements of the course and the accountability program and do not sell/rent a property within a year. You are required to complete all steps of the ongoing accountability program, including and not limited to: all calls, uploading contacts into CRM, email blasts, social media marketing blasts, personal development courses etc.
